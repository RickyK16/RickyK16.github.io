<h2 style="color:red;">The Experience</h2>
<p>Released in 2019, Outer Wilds is a video game for most platforms, including PC. It was developed by Mobius Digital and published by Annapurna Interactive. 
I first picked up Outer Wilds about six months after it's initial release after a close friend recommended it to me, and it was the first I heard about the game.
The game seemed to have little online presence, but after the recommendation, I decided to give it a try. Many people are inspired, or changed, by certain works of art.
I've personally heard that many people were challenged to rethink their perspective on a certain issue because of a good book, and I know many people that
have decided to pursue a career in filmmaking after seeing a movie that particularly spoke to them. This was the artpiece that spoke to me. I can say,
with confidence, that Outer Wilds has without a doubt, changed my life for the better, and I hope if you give it a try, it may have a similar effect on you.</p>

<h2 style="font-family:courier;">The Journey</h2>
<p>In Outer Wilds, you play as a humanoid alien on a goldilocks planet known as Timber Heath. It's from the Hearth that the player character joins the planet's
own space program, and is tasked with doing whatever they please in exploring the solar system. With 6 planets in the solar system, and some moons and miscellaneous places as well,
the player has plenty of room to explore.

</div>
Each planet the character is brought to explore brings it's own unique character to the table. From Brittle Hollow, a rough and rocky planet with a black hole at it's center,
to Dark Bramble, a planet that seems to be spacially incoherent, the solar system of Outer Wilds is a mystical setting to explore, full of mysteries for the player to unfold. There is a story beneath
the surface of this setting as well, as the player can learn more about strange scientific phenomena, ancient experiments, and a long extinct alien race, all to discover the universe's most
hidden, untold secret. And while all this may seem daunting, don't fear, you have plenty of time to explore it all, the universe isn't going to end anytime soon.</p>

<h2><b>The Recommendation</b></h2>
<p>Outer Wilds is a game that I wish I could tell you all about. I could go on about every detail, every purposely-placed stone, every mind-blowing revelation, about the point the 
developers are trying to make, but I can't. Outer Wilds is a piece of art that is best experienced blind, and I refuse to spoil it for you, dear reader. I really do urge that you give it a try,
It's something that you can only experience once, and I wish I could experience again. This is one of those things that could only be expressed in a video game, and If you think that
video games aren't an artform, I urge you to give this one your time. This game is small, but has such a cult following of people who have been blown away by it.
I've seen my youth pastor deliver a sermon about this game, I've seen my little brother conquer his fear of death, I've learned how to never take my own life for granted.
If it's today, if it's tomorrow, if it's next year or next decade, I hope you play Outer Wilds sooner rather than later, the universe isn't going to end anytime soon. </p>
